# Portfolio website for a graphic designer

This is a portfolio website built using Tailwind CSS and Vanilla JS.

If you want to use the template, download the files and install tailwind css using npm.
Then you should be able to run the "buildcss" script and start coding!

The css on the src file is the one you should edit.
